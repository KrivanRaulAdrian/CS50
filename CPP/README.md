## C++ Statements

- A statement is a basic unit of computation in a C++ program.
- Every C++ program is a collection of statements organized in a certain way to achieve some goal.
- Statements end with a semicolon in C++ (;).

- Statements are executed in order from top top bottom when the program is run.
- Execution keeps going until there is a statement causing the program to terminate, or run another sequence of statements.

## C++ Functions

- A function must be defined before it's use.
